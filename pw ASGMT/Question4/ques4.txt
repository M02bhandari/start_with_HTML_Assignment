Question 4---> A Short Note on Tags and element  with an 

Ans---->  Tags and elements are fundamental concepts in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), 
which is the standard language used to create web pages. 
HTML uses a system of tags and elements to structure and format content for display in web browsers.

Tags:

Tags are the building blocks of HTML and are used to define the structure and content of a web page.
Tags are enclosed in angle brackets ("<>" symbols) and are often in pairs, consisting of an opening tag and a closing tag.
The opening tag specifies the beginning of an element, while the closing tag denotes the end of that element.
Tags can also contain attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
Elements:

An HTML element is a complete set of tags and the content they enclose. Elements are the basic units of HTML documents.
Elements are made up of opening and closing tags and the content between them.
Elements can be nested inside other elements to create a hierarchical structure for organizing content on a webpage.
Example:
Let's take a simple example of an HTML paragraph element to understand how tags and elements work:

html
Copy code
<p>This is a <em>short</em> example of HTML tags and elements.</p>
In this example:

<p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, indicating the start of a new paragraph.
</p> is the closing tag for the paragraph element, marking the end of the paragraph.
Inside the paragraph, we have the text "This is a" followed by <em> and </em> tags. <em> is an opening tag for an emphasized text element, and </em> is the closing tag. This makes the word "short" italicized.
The entire structure, including the opening and closing paragraph tags and the emphasized text element, forms a complete HTML element.
When this HTML code is rendered in a web browser, it will display as follows:
"This is a short example of HTML tags and elements."

In summary, HTML uses tags and elements to structure and format content on web pages. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and are often used in pairs to define the beginning and end of elements. Elements consist of opening and closing tags and the content they enclose, and they can be nested to create complex structures.
