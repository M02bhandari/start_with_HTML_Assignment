    The purpose of comments in HTML is to provide explanations, documentation, and notes within the code that are not
    displayed in the web browser. Comments are intended for developers to clarify code, document its functionality,
    assist in debugging, and facilitate collaboration. They improve code readability and maintainability. -->
